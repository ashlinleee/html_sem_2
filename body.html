    <h2>Grimm Fairy Tales</h2>
    <p>
    Here's the revised text with the superscripts removed:
Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were two of 10 children from Dorothea (née Zimmer) and Philipp Wilhelm Grimm. Philipp was a highly regarded district magistrate in Steinau an der Straße, about 50 kilometres (31 mi) from Hanau. Jacob and Wilhelm were sent to school for a classical education once they were of age, while their father was working. They were very hard-working pupils throughout their education. They followed in their father's footsteps and started to pursue a degree in law, and German history. However, in 1796, their father died at the age of 44 from pneumonia.

 This was a tragic time for the Grimms because the family lost all financial support and relied on their aunt, Henriette Zimmer, and grandfather, Johann Hermann Zimmer. At the age of 11, Jacob was compelled to be head of the household and provide for his family.
 After downsizing their home because of financial reasons, Henriette sent Jacob and Wilhelm to study at the prestigious high school, Lyzeum, in Kassel. In school, their grandfather wrote to them saying that because of their current situation, they needed to apply themselves industriously to secure their future welfare.
Shortly after attending Lyzeum, their grandfather died and they were again left to themselves to support their family in the future. The two became intent on becoming the best students at Lyzeum, since they wanted to live up to their deceased father. They studied more than twelve hours a day and established similar work habits. They also shared the same bed and room at school. After four years of rigorous schooling, Jacob graduated head of his class in 1802. Wilhelm contracted asthma and scarlet fever, which delayed his graduation by one year although he was also head of his class. Both were given special dispensations for studying law at the University of Marburg. They particularly needed this dispensation because their social standing at the time was not high enough to have normal admittance. University of Marburg was a small, 200-person university where most students were more interested in activities other than schooling. Most of the students received stipends even though they were the richest in the state. The Grimms did not receive any stipends because of their social standing; however, they were not upset by it since it kept the distractions away.

    Jacob attended the university first and showed proof of his hard work ethic and quick intelligence. Wilhelm joined Jacob at the university, and Jacob drew the attention of Professor Friedrich Carl von Savigny, founder of its historical school of law. He became a prominent personal and professional influence on the brothers. Throughout their time at university, the brothers became quite close with Savigny and were able to use his personal library as they became interested in German law, history, and folklore. Savigny asked Jacob to join him in Paris as an assistant, and Jacob went with him for a year. While he was gone, Wilhelm became very interested in German literature and started collecting books. Once Jacob returned to Kassel in 1806, he adopted his brother's passion and changed his focus from law to German literature. While Jacob studied literature and took care of their siblings, Wilhelm continued on to receive his degree in law at Marburg. During the Napoleonic Wars, Jacob interrupted his studies to serve the Hessian War Commission.

In 1808, their mother died, and this was especially hard on Jacob as he took the position of father figure, while also trying to be a brother. From 1806 to 1810, the Grimm family had barely enough money to properly feed and clothe themselves. During this time, Jacob and Wilhelm were concerned about the stability of the family.

Achim von Arnim and Clemens Brentano were good friends of the brothers and wanted to publish folk tales, so they asked the brothers to collect oral tales for publication. The Grimms collected many old books and asked friends and acquaintances in Kassel to tell tales and to gather stories from others. Jacob and Wilhelm sought to collect these stories in order to write a history of old German Poesie and to preserve history.
The first volume of the first edition was published in 1812, containing 86 stories; the second volume of 70 stories followed in 1815. For the second edition, two volumes containing the Kinder- und Hausmärchen (KHM) texts were issued in 1819 and the appendix was removed and published separately in the third volume in 1822, totaling 170 tales. The third edition appeared in 1837, the fourth edition in 1840, the fifth edition in 1843, the sixth edition in 1850, and the seventh edition in 1857. Stories were added, and also removed, from one edition to the next, until the seventh held 210 tales. Some later editions were extensively illustrated, first by Philipp Grot Johann and, after his death in 1892, by German illustrator Robert Leinweber.

The first volumes were much criticized because, although they were called "Children's Tales", they were not regarded as suitable for children, both for the scholarly information included and the subject matter. Many changes through the editions – such as turning the wicked mother of the first edition in Snow White and Hansel and Gretel (shown in original Grimm stories as Hänsel und Grethel) to a stepmother, were probably made with an eye to such suitability. Jack Zipes believes that the Grimms made the change in later editions because they "held motherhood sacred".

They removed sexual references—such as Rapunzel's innocently asking why her dress was getting tight around her belly, and thus naively revealing to the witch Dame Gothel her pregnancy and the prince's visits—but, in many respects, violence, particularly when punishing villains, become more prevalent.

    The Grimm brothers' initial intention with their first book, "Children's and Household Tales," was to establish a name for themselves in the literary world. After publishing the first volume of "Kinder- und Hausmärchen" (KHM) in 1812, they released a second, expanded, and re-edited volume in 1815. Following this, in 1816, Volume I of "Deutsche Sagen" (German Legends) was published, followed by Volume II in 1818. Surprisingly, it was not any of their tales but Jacob's "German Grammar" in 1819 that truly established their international success. 

In 1825, the Brothers Grimm published their "Kleine Ausgabe" or "small edition," featuring a selection of 50 tales specifically designed for child readers and illustrated by Ludwig Emil Grimm. This children's version went through ten editions between 1825 and 1858.

In 1830, Jacob became a professor at the University of Göttingen, followed by Wilhelm in 1835. During these years, Jacob authored a third volume of German Grammar, while Wilhelm prepared the third revision of "Children's and Household Tales."

However, in 1837, their academic pursuits faced a political challenge when King Ernst August II revoked the constitution of 1833, aiming to restore absolutism in the Kingdom of Hanover. This led to the brothers' protest against taking an oath of allegiance, ultimately resulting in their departure from Göttingen.

In Kassel, the Grimms dedicated themselves to research and study, with the support of friends like Bettina von Arnim. With the backing of influential figures like Savigny and the King of Prussia, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, they were granted positions at the University of Berlin in 1841.

The Grimm brothers held a deep belief that language and history were the fundamental pillars of culture, embodying its most natural and pure forms. Their work not only contributed to the preservation of folklore but also influenced a generation of collectors and writers, inspiring a sense of romantic nationalism.

Their conviction in the importance of national folklore led them to collect tales and view them as representative of the respective countries they originated from. This belief, however, sometimes led to a neglect of cross-cultural influences. Nonetheless, their influence extended far beyond their homeland, inspiring collectors like Alexander Afanasyev in Russia, Peter Christen Asbjørnsen and Jørgen Moe in Norway, Joseph Jacobs in England, and Jeremiah Curtin in America.

Although their collection received criticism at times, it also garnered praise and recognition. W. H. Auden, for example, hailed the Grimms' tales as foundational works of Western culture during World War II. However, their tales were also misappropriated for ideological purposes, as seen in Adolf Hitler's endorsement of them as folkish tales promoting racially pure marriage partners.
Despite such misinterpretations, the Grimm tales have been used in various contexts, including literature addressing the Holocaust, such as Jane Yolen's "Briar Rose." Wilhelm Grimm's individual works, such as "Old Danish Heroic Songs, Ballads, and Folktales," "On German Runes," and "The German Heroic Saga," further contributed to their scholarly legacy.

Moreover, the Grimm anthology has served as a wellspring of inspiration for artists and composers, with illustrious figures like Arthur Rackham, Walter Crane, and Rie Cramer creating captivating illustrations based on the stories. Their enduring influence continues to resonate across artistic and literary domains, ensuring the perpetuation of their rich cultural heritage.
